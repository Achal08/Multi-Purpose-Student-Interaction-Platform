# Multi-Purpose-Student-Interaction-Platform
This Portal is an open forum where college students can communicate with seniors, faculty members, placement cell, representatives of corporations and alumni of universities. Students can ask questions/queries about placements, education, and general life by entering the question into the insert query page where everyone who wishes to address the specific question can be answered by defining the Query ID. First, though, a user must register and then sign in to access the next pages.

All the queries are stored in a database. Database in the project have following two tables -

1. Student login details
